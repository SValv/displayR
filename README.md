# displayR
This is a package for easy and quick exploration and visualisation of data made by Simon Valverde(@SValv), if you encounter any bugs or problems please feel free to contact me on github or via email to s.valverde146@gmail.com. Since I am fairly new to coding and have no experience with development of anything this is actually very likely. I'd also welcome feedback of any kind to improve this little baby-project.   This project is generally directed to people with little experience in R who are interested in easy and quick visualisation and exploration.

## Installation

If you want to install displayR you have to make sure you have devtools and Rtools installed.
You can get Rtools here https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/ - I used Rtools 35 for the installation, but higher versions should work too.

To get devtools you can just use the line of code below:
```{r ,echo=T,eval=F}
install.packages(devtools)
```

If you followed the steps, to get displayR from my GitHub just use:

```{r ,echo=T,eval=F}
devtools::install_github("SValv/displayR")
```
There is a high probability that RStudio wants to update packages you got preinstalled from github. Just download all to ensure functionality.
