# displayR
this is a package for easy and quick exploration and visualisation of data made by Simon Valverde(@svalv), if you encounter any bugs or problems please feel free to contact me on github or via email to s.valverde146@gmail.com. Since i am farely new to coding and have no expirience with development of anything this is actually very likely. I'd also welcome feedback of any kind to improve this little baby-project.   This project is generally directed to people with little expirience in R who are interessted in easy and quick visualisation and exploration.
